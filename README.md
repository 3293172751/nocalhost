## Nocalhost

The term Nocalhost originates from No Local, which is a cloud-native development tool based on IDE, provides realtime cloud native application developing experience. 

When developing cloud-based application in Nocalhost, any code changes can immediately take effects in remote side, and there is no need to rebuild a new image. This can shorten the entire development feedback loops and massively improve R&D efficiency.

In order to give you a better understanding of Nocalhost, it is recommended that you read our blog post [Nocalhost - Refine Cloud Native Dev Environment](https://nocalhost.dev/Blog/redefine-cloud-native-dev-environment/)

## Start cloud-native application development in one click

No need to config complex dev environments in your local machine anymore. Nocalhost helps you to connect to any Kubernetes environment in one click.

### See code change under a second

automatically synchronize the code to container every time you make a change. Nocalhost eliminate the submit, building and pushing cycles,  significantly speed up the feedback loop of development, so you see change in under a second.

### Isolated development space

Every team member can enjoy their own independent development space to ensure that they are not disturbed by others.
